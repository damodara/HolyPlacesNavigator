        "description": "The Radha-Madana-mohana temple, founded by Srila Sanatana Goswami, occupies a special position in Gaudiya Vaishnavism. Madana-mohana temple was attacked by Muslims during the time of Aurangzeb in around 1670. Later on, new temple was built next to the original structures. Caretakers of these Deities brought Them to Karauli for safety. Radha-Madana-mohan Mandir is \"Visiting card\" of Vrindavan. A very ancient temple was built by Sanatana Goswami. When Lord Krishna left this planet five thousand years ago His great-grandson, Vajranabha, wanted to establish shrines dedicated to Him and to install Deities therein. The first Deity to be carved was Madana-mohana. At that time, the only person still living who had directly seen Krishna was Uttara, the widowed wife of Arjuna's son, Abhimanyu, who had been killed during the Battle of Kuruksetra. Thus Vajranabha called her to be present when the murti of Madana-mohana was being made. When the carving was completed, she inspected the Deity and said: \u201cYes, this looks just like Krsna - up to the waist\".\r\n\r\nDuring the time of Lord Caitanya Madana-mohana was being worshiped by Srila Sanatana Gosvami. Before Lord Caitanya visited Vrindavan Advaita Acarya came there and stayed for some time. It is said that one morning local girls approached him and told about the location of the Modana-Mohan Deity. Following their instructions, he was able to find Him, and then he worshiped this Deity for some time. Before returning to Navadvipa, shortly before the arrival of Mahaprabhu, he entrusted the worship of the Deity to Chauba, the brahmana from Mathura, from whom Srila Sanatana Gosvami received Him. \r\n\r\nMadana-mohan is the Deity Who precides over the stage of Krishna consciousness known as sambandha or the establishing of one\u2019s the forgotten relationship with the Lord. Madana-mohan means \"the attractor of Cupid\".\r\nThe understanding is that if one worships Madana-mohana very attentively, particularly in the earlier stages of devotional service, one will be protected from material desires and thus be able to become fixed in Krsna consciousness, despite being spiritually inexperienced.\r\n\r\nSamadhi of Sanatana Goswami\r\n\r\nIn 1558 on the Guru Purnima day (which normally falls on July) Srila Sanatana Goswami left this world at Manasi-ganga at Govardhana Hill. The devotees though brought his transcendental body to Vrindavana town, where it was buried immediately on the western side of the Madana-mohana temple."

        "description": "Sri Govinda was originally established about 5000 years ago by the great-grandson of Lord Krishna. For a long time the Deity was considered lost. Rupa Gosvami experiencing separation sat once under a tree on the banks of the Yamuna. A handsome boy approached him and told him about the hill where cows spontaneously release their milkon the ground every day. The boy suddenly vanished and Rupa Goswami went to this place. He began to dig there and uncovered the Deity of Sri Govindaji. \r\n\r\nThe temple of Sri Radha-Govindaji was built in Vrindavan in 1590 by Maharaj Man Singh, the commander of the army of Emperor Akbar. Maharaj Man Singh was a disciple of Raghunatha Bhatta Goswami, one of the six chief gosvamis of Vrindavan. The Govindaji Temple was a magnificent seven-story mandir with an altar of marble, silver and gold. Architecturally this temple is one of the finest in North India. Several thousand people worked for five full years to complete it. Akbar himself donated red sandstone for its construction. In 1670, during the reign of Aurangzeb, the temple was plundered and destroyed. During the destruction, when there were only 3 floors left, suddenly the earth began to shake and people of Aurangzeb got scared and fled. Worship takes place in the new Govindaji Mandir (located behind the original temple). The original Govindaji is worshiped in Jaipur. On the south side there is a small temple 12 steps away from which there is a cave where the Deity of Govinda was found and where Rupa Goswami was meditating. Also there is the Deity of Yoga-maya on a lion. In addition, there is a stone slab with the imprint of Krishna. In about 1728 (some say - in 1735) Govindaji deity was brought to the city of Amber near Jaipur by Maharaj Jai Singh II for protection from Muslims. Govindaji deity is that, \"who satisfies the cows and the senses engaged in devotional service\". Govinda reveals the abhidheya-jnana to us."

        "description": "After Uttara had Govindadeva's darshana, Vajranabha arranged for the carving of the third Deity of Krsna, Sri Gopinatha. When Uttara was called to inspect the extraordinary form, she said: \"Yes, He looks just like Krsna. Particularly His chest is just like Krishna's!\" Gopinatha is Krsna as \u201cthe master of the gopis\u201d. Therefore He is considered the topmost form of the Lord. He presides over the stage of prayojana or the supreme goal of life, krsna-prema, pure love of Krsna. \r\n\r\nEven before the time of Lord Caitanya, as was the case for the other main Deities, Gopinatha was hidden to be saved from the ravages of the Muslim. Later on Madhu Pandit and his close friend Paramananda Bhattacharya (both disciples of Sri Gadadhara Pandita of the Pancha-tattva), while walking along the banks of the Yamuna in the Vamshivata area of Vrindavana found Him buried in the sand.\r\n\r\nThe Bhakti-ratnakara says: \"Thus Sri Madhu Pandit became the servant of Sri Gopinatha, whose bodily luster steals away the minds of everyone. Hundreds and thousands of people came running to see Him, famed personified sweetness. When the soothing sweetness and coolness of His charming form entered their hearts through their eyes, they found that the blazing fire of material existence, that had previously been burning, was now extinguished.\" (Bhakti-ratnakara, 2.478-482)\r\n\r\nIn 1589, Madhu Pandit constructed a temple for Gopinatha about one kilometer North of the Govindaji temple. There Gopinatha was worshipped until 1670, when he was taken along with Madana Mohan, Govindadeva and other important Deities of Vrindavan to Jaipur by Maharaja Jai Singh. Thereafter the original temple was damaged but later a new temple was built immediately adjacent to the old one by the same Nanda Kumar Vasu who had constructed the new Govindaji temple in Vrindavana. As one walks through the corridor toward the courtyard of the new temple the old temple is on the right.\r\n\r\nThe Deities are very unusual in the new Gopinatha temple in Vrindavana. Normally Srimati Radharani is on our right of Krsna as we look at the altar, but here Srimati Radharani is on our left of the Lord, while Her younger sister, Ananga Manjari, is on our right of him. Out of affection for Her little sister Srimati Radharani allows her to take this most privileged position so that she may render service in the most intimate ways."

The Deity was carved by Rupa Gosvami and given as a present to his beloved disciple, Jiva Gosvami, who later built a temple here. Worship of the Deity began in 1542. In 1558 this land was purchased and the Deity was installed by nasimhasana. \r\n\r\nIn ancient times, this area was the center of Seva-kunji and the place of bhajana Rupa Gosvami. Every day, he gave lectures on the Srimad-Bhagavatam to other Gosvamis and his close disciples, and told them about Krsna's pastimes. Srila Prabhupada said that the Radha-Damodara temple is the center of the spiritual world because of the transcendental activities performed here by the followers of Lord Caitanya under the guidance of Srila Rupa Gosvami. In addition to the Deity Sri Sri Radha-Damodara, the temple contains the Deities Radha-Vrndavana Chandra Srila Krsnadasa Kaviraj, Radha-Madhava Srila Jayadeva Gosvami, Radha-Chalachikana Srila Bhurgarbha Gosvami, and Govardhana-Shila Srila Sanatana Gosvami with the footprints of Lord Krsna. \r\n\r\nSrila Rupa Gosvami's Bhajan-Kutir is located in the courtyard of the Radha-Damodara temple. This place used to be the center of Seva-kunji in ancient times, and it was the place that Rupa Gosvami made his headquarters, where he wrote many books and gave lectures on the Bhagavatam, discussing its topics with other Gosvamis and his followers. \r\n\r\nRupa Gosvami's Samadhi\r\n\r\nHere lies the sacred body of Srila Rupa Gosvami, who entered here in the year 1564. The body of Rupa Gosvami was placed in a Samadhi standing directly opposite the Bhajan-kutira of the great Saint in the courtyard of the Radha-Damodara temple by his closest and dearest disciple, Jiva Gosvami. In the year 1608, Srila Jiva Gosvami entered Samadhi and his body rests next to his favorite Deities, Radha \u2014 Damodara. The youngest of the six Gosvamis of Vrindavana, Jiva Gosvami is considered the greatest philosopher in the history of India. He was also the nephew of Rupa and Sanatana Gosvami. From 1959 to 1972, Srila Prabhupada performed many wonderful activities here, and until he left in 1977, he continued to talk about his abode in Radha-Damodar. \r\n\r\nSamadhi \r\n\r\nSrila Prabhupada brought devotees from all over the world here in 1972. He sat there, and for a month Kartika lectured on \u201cThe nectar of devotion\". The courtyard of the Sri Sri Radha Damodara temple can be seen from the window of Srila Prabhupada's kitchen. Srila Prabhupada was eating Prasad and looking out of the window at the Bhajan-Kutir and Samadhi of Srila Rupa Gosvami, meditating on his mercy."

Gopal Bhatta Gosvami is not mentioned in the Scriptures, he asked Gosvami not to mention his name in his books. He wrote Sat Sandarbha together with Jiva Gosvami and prepared material for works of Rupa Gosvami and Sanatana Gosvami.\r\n\r\nThe Deity belongs to Gopal Bhatta Gosvami, one of the greatest Gosvamis of Vrndavana. Radha Ramana appeared very interesting. Gopal Bhatta Gosvami went to a river in the Himalayas, and when he scooped up water from that river, he had eleven shalagrams in his hand. He put them in a box. As he approached Vrndavana, Gopal Bhatta thought that he was not worthy to worship these shilas, so he returned to the Himalayas, wishing to return the shalagrams to the place from which they came. When he put them in the water, the awls crawled out of the water and crawled into his hand, telling him to worship them.\r\n\r\nGopal Bhatta went down to Vrindavan. He began writing books and worshipping 11 shalagrams.\r\n\r\nBefore the festival of Narasimha Chaturdashi, a rich merchant came to Vrndavana to donate something to the Gosvami Deities. The merchant went around all the Gosvamis distributing donations. When it came to Gopal Bhatta Gosvami's turn, the merchant asked what he needed for the Deities. But Gopal Bhatta said that he has no Deities. At this point, the gop\u0101la Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da was a shame \u2014 all the Gosvami's Deity, and I have Sheila. I can't dress them up, I can't decorate them. He wanted to have a Deity, too. The next morning, when he opened the box, instead of Damodar-Shila, he saw the Deity Radha Raman.\r\n\r\nRadha Raman is a self-manifested Deity. Radha Raman is a special Deity. He is exactly up to the waist like Radha Madana Mohan, chest like Radha Govinda, and face like Radha Gopinatha. Radha Raman is a fusion of all three main Deities of Vrindavan.The name Radharaman means one who brings joy to Srimati Radharani. This is one of the innumerable names of Lord Sri Krsna.\r\n\r\nIn the temple there is no manifested Deity of Srimati Radharani, but next to Ramanaji there is Her crown, which speaks of Her presence. Every evening after 21.00 Radhu Ramana plays the flute before going to sleep. In the inner courtyard of the temple there is a place of appearance of Raja Ramana and the samadhi of Gopal Bhata Goswami."

Gokulananda, the main Deity of the temple, was installed by Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, one of the great acaryas and commentators of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. This is a small Deity of Krishna standing alone without the manifested form of Srimati Radharani. There are also several important Deities on the altar. In the upper left corner (facing the altar) is the pratibhu form of Lord Caitanya, worshiped by Narottama das Thakura. In the center of the pratibhu there are forms of Radha-Vinoda of Lokanatha Goswami. On the right is Radha-Vijaya Govinda, the beloved masters of Baladeva Vidyabhushana. One level below on the left, is Gokulananda, and on the right is Govardhana sila of Lord Caitanya. The Caitanya-caritamrta describes how, upon returning from Vrindavan-dhama to Jagannatha Puri, a devotee named Sankarananda Sarasvati presented Lord Caitanya Govardhana with a sila along with a small garland of gunja berries. The Lord accepted these gifts with great joy and began to worship sila with great love. He brought the sila to His heart and sometimes to His eyes. \r\n\r\nSometimes He breathed in the scent of an awl and sometimes He applied It to the head. Govardhana sila was constantly bathed in the tears of the Lord's love and sometimes Lord Caitanya bathed the sila in His tears, proclaiming: \u201cThis stone is nothing but the body of Lord Krishna\". It stayed with Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu for three years, after which He gave it to Raghunatha dasa Goswami. Raghunatha dasa Goswami worshiped this Govardhana-sila for several years, and in due time the same sila was handed over to worship Visvanatha Chakravarti Thakur. Today this shila is found in the Radha-Gokulananda temple. In the Radha-Gokulananda temple on Radha Kund you can see the pushpa-samadhi of Lokanatha Goswami and the cave in which Lokanatha performed his bhajan. The pushpa samadhi of the only disciple of Lokanatha Goswami Narottama Das Tchakura is also located here."

Shyamasundara was given to Shyamananda Prabhu by Srimati Radharani in 1578 during the famous Seva Kunja game. It is said that the Deity Srimati Radharani beside Him is a self-manifested Deity given to Shyamananda Prabhu in 1580 by the Maharaja of Bharatpur. On the arrival of Srimati Radharani, on the day of Vasanta Panchami, the marriage ceremony of the Divine Couple was performed. The Sri Sri Radha Shyamsundara temple has found a special place for itself in the hearts of all Vaishnavas because it houses the most beautiful and unique Deity Sri Shyamsundar, who manifested from the heart of Srimati Radharani. All the prominent acaryas of the Gaudiya Vashnavism visited this divine Temple to get darshan of His Lordship \u2014 Sri Shyamsundar. During the daily darsana of this transcendental deity, Srila Jiva Gosvami, Sri Gopala Bhatta Gosvami, Srila Loknath Gosvami, and Sri Bhugarbha Gosvami, and many others, usually went deep into the ocean of ecstasy. Srila Raghunath das Gosvami and Srila Krsna das Kaviraja Gosvami, who usually never left Sri Radha Kundu, also visited Vrindavan for Sri Shyamsundar's darshan, despite their old age and physical problems."

He is a Deity of Krishna on His own who was discovered in Nidhuvan on the eastern side of Vrindavana town by Swami Haridasa, a contemporary of the six Gosvamis. Some say He is a combined form of Radha and Krsna. The pujaris have a practice of opening and closing the curtains in front of Bankebihari every minute or so. The story goes that when Haridasa found Bankebihari, he would keep Him in his hut, and from time to time go out to do madhukari, which is begging for food. Bankebihari would become anxious when Haridasa would leave Him, and would sometimes run out of the hut and try to locate him. In order to avoid the possibility of Bankebihari running away and becoming lost, Haridasa was forced to stay in the hut practically the whole time, and when he did have to go out, Haridasa would close the curtain in front of the Deity\u2019s altar. Nowadays the pujaris are afraid that if Bankebihari gets the opportunity He may go running out of the temple looking for Haridasa again, so they don\u2019t leave the curtains open for more than a minute or so at a time."

These Gaura-Nitai Deities reflect Murari Gupta\u2019s connection with Lord Rama, as They are standing with Their hands in the mudras of Rama and Laksmana holding bows and arrows. He was an incarnation of Hanuman, and therefore had a very deep relationship with Lord Rama, the nature of which is explained in detail in the chapter of Caitanya-bhagavata dealing with the Mahaprakasa lila. The Deities were lost until about 200 years ago when devotees living where Murari Gupta had previously resided noticed that every day a cow would go to a particular place there and release her milk. When they dug at that spot, they found these Deities. Initially, a devotee named Balarama Pandita started to worship Them, but one day They were visited by a lady named Candrasasi Mukhopadhyaya, who became fascinated by Them, and following that would come and see Them every day. Once she prepared sweet rice for Them, and then that night They appeared to her in a dream and told her, \u201cGive Us some more sweet rice. It was really nice!\u201d The Deity of Lord Caitanya was pulling at her sari, and as He pulled, the edge of her cloth tore off. When she woke up, she found her sari had actually become torn, and that the Deity of Lord Caitanya had the piece of cloth in His hand. It was then that Candrasasi mataji took over Their worship."

First, one of the gopis covered her eyes while Krsna, Srimati Radharani, and the others hid in the forest, and then the gopi had to locate them among the trees, which she managed to do quite quickly. Each of the gopis took a turn to be the one who had to find everyone else, until finally Krsna had a chance. Srimati Radharani covered His eyes and gave the gopis a minute to hide, and then Krsna began to search for them. However, even though He tried His best, searching high and low, still He was not able to find the gopis. At last, they emerged from their hiding places, laughing very sweetly.

If you follow this road, the Mirabai temple will be at the very end of it.\r\n Mirabai is a famous Saint of India, and she spent part of her life in Vrindavana. Born about 1500, the year in Chaukori in Rajasthan, like a Princess in a wealthy family. When she was three years old, a sadhu came to their house and gave her father the Deity of Krishna. He did not dare to give it to Meera because he was afraid that she would not be able to appreciate it, but when Meera saw Krsna, she insisted on receiving it, and began to cry and refuse to eat until it was given to Her. As time went on, her circumstances at home deteriorated, and after the death of her husband, she went to Sri Vrindavna-Dhama, and stopped at the place where the temple is now located. On the altar are the Radha - manohara, and to the left of the Deities (in relation to us) The deity of Mirabai singing kirtan. To the right of the altar is a small room where, according to legend, she lived.\r\n Srila Prahupada said that mirabai appreciated Lord Caitanya: \"She recognized that Lord Caitanya is Krsna, and even wrote one song:' Now You have given up your flute and accepted the sannyasi way.' She wrote beautiful poems. \"Where are Your hair and peacock feather? Now You are shaven.\" Thus, the World took It\u00bbaTo reach this temple you must walk past Radha - Damodara till you come to the road to Srngara Vata, and then directly opposite it turn right. If you walk along this road, you find the Mirabai temple on the right just before the end.\r\n\r\nMirabai is a famous female saint of India, and some of her life was spent in Vrndavana. She was born around 1500 in Chaukari in Rajasthan, as a princess in a royal family, and when she was three a sadhu visited the palace and gave her father a Deity of Krsna. He was reluctant to give it to Mira, as he was afraid she might not value it, but when Mira saw Krsna she insisted on having Him, and screamed and refused to eat until He was given to her. \r\n\r\nAs time went on things worsened for her at home, one day, after the death of her husband, she secretly left for Sri Vrndavana-dhama and settled at the place where this temple is today. On the altar are Radha-Manohara, and on our left side of Them is a Deity of Mirabai playing karatalas. To the right of the altar area is a small room that is said to have been her sitting place.\r\n\r\nSrila Prabhupada mentions that Mirabai appreciated Lord Caitanya, \u201cShe appreciated that Lord Caitanya is Krsna, and she has written one poetry, song, that \u2018Now You have left aside Your flute, and You have taken the sannyasi rod.\u2019 In that way, she has written nice poetry. \u2018And where is Your hair and peacock feather? Now You are bald-headed.\u2019 In this way. So Mira appreciated.\u201d"

His idea was that Radha-Ramana should come from His small temple to this magnificent palace where He could be more easily taken care of, and the whole ambiance would be more in keeping with His position as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Radha-Ramana Himself, however, had other ideas and refused to come, so other Deities were installed. \r\nThe present Deities are known as \u201cChota Radha-Ramana,\u201d or \u201cSmall Radha-Ramana.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn front of the temple are twelve four-meter tall pillars of carved marble, each made from a single piece of stone. Inside there is the temple room and another special room known as the \u201cVasanti Kamra\u201d or the \u201cSpring Room\u201d where the Deities stay for two days a year around the time of Vasant Pancami, the day of the lunar calendar on which spring officially starts. In this room, there is an outstanding collection of old Belgian chandeliers and ornamental light fixtures which are lit up for the pleasure of the Deities only on these two days in the year. It is quite a spectacle, and thousands of people come from all over Vraja to have this special darsana."

Sarvabhauma was a member of one of the Gosvami families of the Radha-Ramana temple in Vrndavana. One of his disciples in Calcutta, Radha-Govinda Gosvami, installed the Deity in Calcutta. Radha-Govinda Gosvami had no children and, in his later age, wondered who would continue the service of Amiya Nimai, as the Deity had come to be known. Amiya Nimai came to the Gosvami in a dream and told him to contact Krsna Caitanya Gosvami of the Radha-Ramana temple and get him to take Him to Vrndavana.\r\n\r\nFollowing the dream, Radha-Govinda Gosvami and Krsna Caitanya Gosvami discussed the matter for some time in a series of letters without reaching a conclusion, and shortly afterward, Radha-Govinda Gosvami passed away. Krsna Caitanya Gosvami arranged in 1936 that Amiya Nimai be transported from Calcutta to Vrndavana, where He was installed in a room by the rasa-mandala outside the main entrance to the Radha-Ramana temple. The worship went on there for some time, and then in 1954 Krsna Caitanya Gosvami obtained land in the Gopinatha Bazaar area of Vrndavana town, and Amiya Nimai\u2019s new temple was opened there in 1956.\r\n\r\nHe is a magnificent Deity and is worshiped very nicely, still under the care of the devotees of Radha-Ramana temple."

But the Holy name of Lord Krsna is non-different from Him, so if I chant in the bathroom, He will be exposed to all the nastiness there. If I could, I would simply stop chanting, but the problem is that I can't stop no matter how hard I try, and therefore I am holding My tongue to avoid making that offense\".Gopala replied: \"Please don't worry, my Lord. The time of death is the most contaminated time of all even worse than when we are in the bathroom, but sastras say that at the time of death, we must chant the Holy names of the Lord. So it is all right for you to chant in the bathroom\u201d. \r\nLord Caitanya was astonished and said: \"Thank you so much, Gopala! You've convinced me! From today on, you are my guru\u00bb. From that time, Gopal became known as Gopal Guru, and later, when he took sannyasa, he became known as Gopala Guru Gosvami. \r\nThe Deities in the Radhakanta temple in Vrindavana are pratibhu forms of the original Deities in Puri. On the right side of the temple courtyard is the Deity of Gopala Guru, and to the left of this Deity is the tree that he is said to have been sitting under and chanting, when his followers found him."

It seems that he lived most of his life in Bengal. His complete Samadhi is located in the center of the courtyard of this temple. One day, Lord Caitanya went to see Gauridasa at Ambika Kalna, after crossing the Ganges in a boat from Shantipur. He told the Pandit: \"I went to Shantipur, from there I sailed on the boat to the village Haryadi. I crossed the Ganges in a rowboat. This is the paddle you take it. I give it to you. With this paddle, humanity can cross the ocean of this material world.\" Having said this, the Lord embraced Gauridasa Pandita. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu personally told Gauridas to carve the Deities of himself and Lord Nityananda out of the neem tree, which He did. He worshipped Them day and night, chanting the Holy names of the Lord, and the Deities communicated with him every day. One day he prepared a great feast for Gaura-Nitai and placed it on the altar before Them, but They were silent. In anger Gauridas said to the Deities: \"If You are satisfied without food, why do You force me to cook for You? \" the Gaura-Nitai replied,\"Gauridas, you are never satisfied with cooking a small amount of food. You always want to cook a lot. When We ask you not to cook so much, you never listen. It hurts Us to see how hard you work just to make Us dinner. Remember, the most pleasant offering for Us will be something that will be easy for you to prepare.\" Gauridas replied: \"I will never do it again! From this moment on, I will only offer You boiled rice and spinach!\u00bb The two gentlemen laughed and began to eat what he had prepared for Them. \"You have so much devotion that whatever you prepare will satisfy Us very much,\" said Lord Nityananda."

Some of the Vrajavasis took it that Krsna was trying to preach jnana to them and somehow cheat them of His personal association, so they tore the letters, which were written on cloth inti rags and threw them into the Yamuna here. Therefore, this place is known traditionally as Jnana Gudadi, the place where the Jnana was torn into rags.

Durvasa replied: \"Just meditate on me as a sage who eats only durva grass, and the Yamuna will give you a path.\" \r\nSrimati Radharani reflected for a moment and then asked him, \"We know Krsna very well. He always pursues us for amorous pastimes. How can anyone say He\u2019s a brahmacari? And we just saw you eat a big feast. How could anyone say you eat only durva grass?\u201d When she placed these questions before Durvasa Muni, the other girls became silent. \r\nDurvasa answered their second question, regarding himself first, \"Sound is contained within the element ether, although sound and ether are different. The ether does not know this. And I am spirit. How can I be a materialistic enjoyer? Touch is contained within the element air, although touch and air are different. The air doesn't know this. I am a spirit. How can I be a materialistic enjoyer? Form is contained within the element fire, although - form and fire are different. Fire doesn't know this. And I am a spirit."

In \"Srimad-Bhagavatam\" it is explained that following the pastime of the stealing of the clothes of the gopis, Krisna\u2019s cowherd boyfriends were feeling very hungry as due to the excitement of that pastimes, they have forgotten to eat lunch. They therefore appealed to Krsna to help them satisfy their hunger. He directed them to approach some brahmanas who were performing an animal sacrifice nearby and request in His and Balarama\u2019s names to give some food. The boys went and very humbly presented their please to the brahmanas, but they arrogantly ignored the boys, who then ran back to Lord Krsna. \r\nKrsna told the boys to approach the wives of the same brahmanas and ask them,as they were His devotees. The boys went and requested the ladies to give food as Krishna was nearby and was very hungry. The chaste ladies immediately gathered all different types of nice food, and despite the objections of their husbands, came to meet Krsna here on the banks of the River Yamuna."

First Krsna and Balarama bathed, and then, when They returned to sit in the chariot, Akrura took permission from Them to take bath. He was standing half-submerged in the Yamuna, chanting gayatri, when he suddenly saw Krishna and Balarama in the water again. Surprised, he came out of the water, but then saw that They were still seated in the chariot, and he thought he must have been mistaken when he thought he saw Them in the water. He went back into the river, but saw Them there again, and this time not alone, but surrounded by all sort of great personalities, including many of the demigods, and a great number of Siddhas, Caranas, and Gandharvas, all of whom were bowing down before Krsna and Balarama. \r\n\r\nLord Sesanaga was also there, dressed in blue clothes, His white necks appearing just like snow-capped mountains. Akrura saw Krsna lying on Ananta Sesa in a four-armed form, looking astonishingly beautiful. Seeing this Akrura was overwhelmed, and he offered beautiful prayer to the Lord, but then suddenly while he was still glorifying Him, the vision disappeared. \r\nWhen Lord Caitanya visited Vrndavana, he stayed here some of the time, spending the nights here and during the day going out to visit different holy places. He once became absorbed here in remembrance of Akrura meditating in the water and seeing Krsna there, and jumped in, staying under water for some time, until his assistant, Balabhadra Bhattacharya, with great difficulty manage to pull Him out. As a result of this incident, Balabhadra Bhattacharya felt forced to take Lord Caitanya out of Vrndavana, and the Lord, even though He did not really want to go, agreed to leave. \r\nIn those days, the Yamuna ran right past where the current temple is located, but now the river has moved some distance away. In the the temple are very nice Deities of Krishna and Balarama with Akrura between Them."
