        "description": "Храм Радхи-Мадана-мохана, основанный Шрилой Санатаной Госвами занимает особое положение в гаудия-вайшнавизме. Храм Мадана-мохана, подвергся нападению мусульман во времена Аурангзеба, примерно в 1670-ом году. Позже рядом с изначальной постройкой был воздвигнут новый храм. Служители этих Божеств перевезли Их в целях безопасности в Кароли. Радха-Мадана-мохан Мандир — «Визитная карточка» Вриндавана. Очень древний храм, построенный Санатаной Госвами. Когда Господь Кришна покинул эту планету пять тысяч лет назад, Его правнук, Ваджранабха, захотел воздвигнуть в Его честь храмы и установить там Божества. Первым было изготовлено божество Мадана-мохана. К тому времени остался всего один человек, который лично видел Кришну — это была Уттара, овдовевшая жена сына Арджуны, Абхиманью, который был убит во время сражения на Курукшетре. Поэтому Ваджранабха попросил её взглянуть на изготовленное мурти Мадана-мохана. Когда работа была окончена, она осмотрела Божество и сказала: «Да, выгладит в точности, как Кришна, от стоп до талии». Во времена Господа Чайтаньи Мадана-мохану поклонялся Шрила Санатана Госвами. Перед тем, как Господь Чайтанья посетил Вриндаван, сюда пришёл Адвайта Ачарья и прожил здесь некоторое время. Говорится, что однажды утром к нему подошли местные девушки и рассказали о местоположении Божества Модана-мохана. Следуя их указаниям, он смог отыскать Его, и потом некоторое время поклонялся этому Божеству. Перед возвращением в Навадвипу, незадолго до прихода Махапрабху, он доверил поклонение Божеству Чаубе, брахману из Матхуры, от которого Его получил Шрила Санатана Госвами..Мадана-мохан — это Божество, отвечающее за ступень сознания Кришны, известную как самбандха, или восстановление своих забытых отношений с Господом. Мадана-мохан означает «Тот, Кто привлекает Купидона». Следует понимать, что если человек со всем вниманием поклоняется Мадана-мохану, особенно на ранних стадиях развития преданного служения, он будет защищен от всех материальных желаний, и таким образом сможет утвердиться в сознании Кришны, несмотря на свою духовную незрелость. Самадхи Санатаны Госвами. В 1558-ом году, в день Гуру-пурнимы (который обычно приходится на июль) Шрила Санатана Госвами ушёл из этого мира на Манаси-Ганге у холма Говардхан. Однако преданные перенесли его трансцендентное тело в город Вриндаван, где оно было сразу захоронено у западной стороны храма Мадана-мохана."

        "description": "Шри Говинда первоначально был установлен около 5000 лет назад правнуком Господа Кришны. Втечение длительного времени Божество считалось утраченным. Рупа Госвами, переживая разлуку, как-то сидел под деревом на берегу Ямуны. К нему подошел красивый мальчик и рассказал о холме, где каждый день коровы льют свое молоко. Мальчик исчез, а Рупа Госвами пошел в это место. Он начал там копать и обнаружил Божество Шри Говиндаджи.храм Шри Радха-Говиндаджи во Вриндаване построил в 1590 году махарадж Ман-Сингх, полководец армии императора Акбара. Махарадж Ман Сингх был учеником Рагхунатхи Бхатты Госвами, одного из шести главных госвами Вриндавана. Храм Говиндаджи был великолепным семиэтажным мандиром с алтарем из мрамора, серебра и золота. Архитектурно это храм является одним из лучших в Северной Индии. Несколько тысяч человек работали в течение пяти полных лет, чтобы завершить ее. Сам Акбар пожертвовал красный песчаник для его строительства. В 1670 году, во время правления Аурангзеба храм был разграблен и разрушен. Во время разрушения, когда оставалось всего 3 этажа, вдруг земля начала трястись, и люди Аурангзеба перепугались и убежали. Поклонение идет в новом Говиндаджи Мандире (расположенном за изначальным храмом). Изначальному Говиндаджи поклоняются в Джайпуре. С южной стороны есть небольшой храм в 12 шагах от которого, расположена пещера, где было найдено Божество Говинды и где Рупа Госвами медитировал. Также там находится Божество Йога-майи на льве. Кроме того, здесь размещена каменная плита с отпечатком Кришны. Божество Говиндаджи приблизительно в 1728 году (некоторые говорят — в 1735) было доставлено в город Амбер, около Джайпура, махараджем Джай-Сингхом ІІ для защиты от мусульман.Божество Говиндаджи «Тот, кто приносит удовлетворение коровам и чувствам, занятым в преданном служении». Говинда раскрывает нам абхидхея-гьяну."

        "description": "После того, как Уттара получила даршан Говиндадевы, по заказу Ваджранабхи было изготовлено третье Божество Кришны — Шри Гопинатха. Когда позвали Уттару посмотреть на эту необычайную форму, она сказала: «Да, Он выглядит в точности как Кришна. Особенно Его грудь в точности, как у Кришны!»Гопинатха — это Кришна, повелитель гопи. Поэтому Он считается самой высшей формой Господа. Он главенствует на уровне прайоджаны, или высшей цели жизни, кришна-премы, чистой любви к Кришне. Ещё до прихода Господа Чайтаньи, как и в случае с другими основными Божествами, Гопинатха был спрятан, чтобы спасти Его от нападений мусульман. В последствии Мадху Пандит и его близкий друг Парамананда Бхаттачарья (оба ученики Шри Гададхары Пандита, члена Панча-таттвы), прогуливаясь по берегу Ямуны в районе Вамшивата города Вриндаван, нашли Его закопанным в песке.\r\n\r\n В «Бхакти-ратнакаре» сказано: «Так Шри Мадху Пандит стал слугой Шри Гопинатхи, Чьё сияние способно пленить ум любого. Сотни и тысячи людей бежали, чтобы увидеть Его, известного как олицетворённая сладость. Когда освежающая сладость Его очаровательной формы входила через глаза в их сердца, обжигающий огонь материального существования, который раньше пылал там, был потушен». (Бхакти-ратнакара, 2.478-482)\r\n\r\nВ 1589-ом году Мадху Пандит построил храм для Гопинатхи примерно в километре к северу от храма Говиндаджи. Гопинатхе поклонялись там до 1670-го года, после чего Он вместе с Мадана-моханом, Говиндадевой и другими важными Божествами Вриндавана был перенесён в Джайпур Махараджей Джай Сингхом.Изначальный храм был повреждён, но позже построили новый храм, который вплотную прилегает к старому. Строительство вёл тот же Нанда Кумар Васу, который построил новый храм Говиндаджи во Вриндаване. Если идти по коридору, ведущему во двор нового храма, старый храм будет справа.\r\n\r\nВ новом храме Гопинатхи во Вриндаване Божества стоят несколько непривычно. Обычно, если смотреть на алтарь, Шримати Радхарани находится справа от Кришны, но здесь Шримати Радхарани стоит слева от Господа, а Её младшая сестра, Ананга Манджари, стоит справа от Него. Из любви к Своей младшей сестре Шримати Радхарани позволяет Ей занять самое привилегированное положение, чтобы та могла совершать самое сокровенное служение."

Шрила Прабхупада говорил, что храм Радхи-Дамодары является центром духовного мира благодаря трансцендентной деятельности, совершаемой здесь последователями Господа Чайтаньи под руководством Шрилы Рупы Госвами. Кроме Божества Шри Шри Радха-Дамодары в храме находятся Божества Радха-Вриндавана Чандры Шрилы Кришнадаса Кавираджа, Радха-Мадхавы Шрилы Джаядевы Госвами, Радха-Чалачикана Шрилы Бхургарбхи Госвами, а также говардхана-шила Шрилы Санатаны Госвами с отпечатками стопы Господа Кришны. Бхаджан-кутир Шрилы Рупы Госвами находится во дворике храма Радха-Дамодары. Это место в давние времена было центром Сева-кунджи и именно это место Рупа Госвами сделал своей штаб-квартирой, здесь он написал множество книг, проводил лекции по «Бхагаватам», обсуждая ее темы с другими Госвами и своими последователями.Самадхи Рупы Госвами\n Здесь покоится священное тело Шрилы Рупы Госвами, вошедшего сюда в год 1564.

        "description": "Это храм Гопал Бхатты Госвами.\n Божество Радха Раман является одним из немногих, сохранившихся изначальных Божеств во Вриндаване, после нашествия мусульман.Гопал Бхатта Госвами не упоминается в писаниях, он просил Госвами не упоминать его имя в своих книгах. Он написал Сат Сандарбхи вместе с Дживой Госвами и подготовил материал для работ Рупы Госвами и Санатаны Госвами.\n Божество принадлежит Гопал Бхатте Госвами, одному из величайших Госвами Вриндавана.Появился Радха Рамана очень интересно.Гопал Бхатта Госвами пошел на реку в Гималаях, и когда он зачерпнул воду из этой реки, у него оказалось в руке одиннадцать шалаграм. Он положил их в коробку. Подходя к Вриндавану, Гопал Бхатта подумал, что недостоин поклоняться этим шилам и, вернулся обратно в Гималаи, желая вернуть шалаграмы в то место, откуда они пришли. Когда он их выложил в воду, шилы выползли из воды, и заползли к нему в ладонь, сказав, чтобы он им поклонялся.\n Гопал Бхатта спустился во Вриндаван. Он стал писать книги и поклоняться 11 шалаграмам.\n Перед праздником Нарасимха Чатурдаши, богатый купец пришел во Вриндаван, он хотел пожертвовать что-то Божествам Госвами. Купец обошел всех Госвами, раздавая пожертвования. Когда дошла очередь до Гопал Бхатты Госвами, купец просил, что же ему нужно для Божеств. Но Гопал Бхатта сказал, что у него нет Божеств. В этот момент Гопал Бхатте стало обидно — у всех Госвами Божества, а у меня шилы. Я не могу их наряжать, я не могу их украшать. Он захотел, чтобы у него тоже было Божество. На следующее утро, когда он открыл коробочку, то вместо Дамодара-шилы он увидел Божество Радха Рамана.\n Радха Раман это самопроявленное Божество. Радха Раман — особое Божество. Он точь-в-точь до пояса, как Радха Мадана Мохан, грудь, как у Радха Говинды, а лицо, как у Радха Гопинатхи. Радха Раман является слиянием всех трех основных Божеств Вриндавана.Имя Радхараман означает «тот, кто приносит радость Шримати Радхарани». Это одно из бесчисленных имен Господа Шри Кришны.\n В храме нет проявленного Божества Шримати Радхарани, но рядом с Раманаджи есть Её корона, которая говорит о Её присутствии.Каждый вечер после 21.00 Радху Раману играют на флейте перед сном.Во внутреннем дворике храма расположено место являния Раджа Рамана и самадхи Гопал Бхаты Госвами."

Гокулананда, главное Божество храма, было установлено Шрилой Вишванатхой Чакраварти Тхакуром, одним из великих ачаръев и комментаторов Гаудия вайшнавизма. Это небольшое Божество Кришны, стоящего в одиночестве, без проявленной формы Шримати Радхарани. На алтаре также стоит несколько важных Божеств. В верхнем левом углу (если стоять лицом к алтарю) находится пратибху форма Господа Чайтаньи, которой поклонялся Нароттама дас Тхакур. По центру пратибху формы Радхи-Виноды Локанатхи Госвами. Справа Радха-Виджайа Говинда, возлюбленные повелители Баладевы Видьябхушаны. Уровнем ниже, слева, находится Гокулананда, а справа Говардхана шила Господа Чайтаньи. В «Чайтанья-чаритамрите» описывается, как по возвращении из Вриндавана-дхамы в Джаганнатха Пури преданный по имени Санкарананда Сарасвати подарил Господу Чайтанье Говардхана шилу вместе с маленькой гирляндой из ягод гунджа. Господь с великой радостью принял эти дары и стал поклоняться шиле с большой любовью. Он подносил шилу к Своему сердцу, а иногда к глазам. Иногда Он вдыхал аромат шилы, а иногда прикладывал Её к голове. Говардхана шила была постоянно омыта слезами любви Господа, а иногда Господь Чайтанья купал шилу в Своих слезах, провозглашая: «Этот камень не что иное, как тело Господа Кришны».Шила пробыла у Шри Чайтаньи Махапрабху в течение трёх лет, после чего Он отдал Её Рагхунатхе дасу Госвами. Рагхунатха дас Госвами поклонялся этой Говардхана-шиле несколько лет, и в положенный срок та же самая шила была передана для поклонения Вишванатхе Чакраварти Тхакуру. В наши дни эта шила находится в храме Радхи-Гокулананды.В храме Радха-Гокулананды на Радха-Кунде можно увидеть пушпа-самадхи Локанатхи Госвами и пещеру, в которой Локанатха проводил свой бхаджан. Здесь же находится пушпа самадхи единственного ученика Локанатхи Госвами Нароттама Даса Тхакура"

Some say He is a combined form of Radha and Krsna. The pujaris have a practice of opening and closing the curtains in front of Bankebihari every minute or so. The story goes that when Haridasa found Bankebihari, he would keep Him in his hut, and from time to time go out to do madhukari, which is begging for food. Bankebihari would become anxious when Haridasa would leave Him, and would sometimes run out of the hut and try to locate him. In order to avoid the possibility of Bankebihari running away and becoming lost, Haridasa was forced to stay in the hut practically the whole time, and when he did have to go out, Haridasa would close the curtain in front of the Deity\u2019s altar. Nowadays the pujaris are afraid that if Bankebihari gets the opportunity He may go running out of the temple looking for Haridasa again, so they don\u2019t leave the curtains open for more than a minute or so at a time."

These Gaura-Nitai Deities reflect Murari Gupta\u2019s connection with Lord Rama, as They are standing with Their hands in the mudras of Rama and Laksmana holding bows and arrows. He was an incarnation of Hanuman, and therefore had a very deep relationship with Lord Rama, the nature of which is explained in detail in the chapter of Caitanya-bhagavata dealing with the Mahaprakasa lila. The Deities were lost until about 200 years ago when devotees living where Murari Gupta had previously resided noticed that every day a cow would go to a particular place there and release her milk. When they dug at that spot, they found these Deities. Initially, a devotee named Balarama Pandita started to worship Them, but one day They were visited by a lady named Candrasasi Mukhopadhyaya, who became fascinated by Them, and following that would come and see Them every day. Once she prepared sweet rice for Them, and then that night They appeared to her in a dream and told her, \u201cGive Us some more sweet rice. It was really nice!\u201d The Deity of Lord Caitanya was pulling at her sari, and as He pulled, the edge of her cloth tore off. When she woke up, she found her sari had actually become torn, and that the Deity of Lord Caitanya had the piece of cloth in His hand. It was then that Candrasasi mataji took over Their worship."

Radharani and the gopis arrived and began a game of hide and seek with Him. First, one of the gopis covered her eyes while Krsna, Srimati Radharani, and the others hid in the forest, and then the gopi had to locate them among the trees, which she managed to do quite quickly. Each of the gopis took a turn to be the one who had to find everyone else, until finally Krsna had a chance. Srimati Radharani covered His eyes and gave the gopis a minute to hide, and then Krsna began to search for them. However, even though He tried His best, searching high and low, still He was not able to find the gopis. At last, they emerged from their hiding places, laughing very sweetly. Because Srimati Radharani had covered Krsna\u2019s eyes here, this place is known as Andhera-ghata, or the ghata of the blind person. Due to the ravages of time, this ghata is no longer present in a manifest form."

If you follow this road, the Mirabai temple will be at the very end of it.\r\n Mirabai is a famous Saint of India, and she spent part of her life in Vrindavana. Born about 1500, the year in Chaukori in Rajasthan, like a Princess in a wealthy family. When she was three years old, a sadhu came to their house and gave her father the Deity of Krishna. He did not dare to give it to Meera because he was afraid that she would not be able to appreciate it, but when Meera saw Krsna, she insisted on receiving it, and began to cry and refuse to eat until it was given to Her. As time went on, her circumstances at home deteriorated, and after the death of her husband, she went to Sri Vrindavna-Dhama, and stopped at the place where the temple is now located. On the altar are the Radha - manohara, and to the left of the Deities (in relation to us) The deity of Mirabai singing kirtan. To the right of the altar is a small room where, according to legend, she lived.\r\n Srila Prahupada said that mirabai appreciated Lord Caitanya: \"She recognized that Lord Caitanya is Krsna, and even wrote one song:' Now You have given up your flute and accepted the sannyasi way.' She wrote beautiful poems. \"Where are Your hair and peacock feather? Now You are shaven.\" Thus, the World took It\u00bbaTo reach this temple you must walk past Radha - Damodara till you come to the road to Srngara Vata, and then directly opposite it turn right. If you walk along this road, you find the Mirabai temple on the right just before the end.\r\n\r\nMirabai is a famous female saint of India, and some of her life was spent in Vrndavana. She was born around 1500 in Chaukari in Rajasthan, as a princess in a royal family, and when she was three a sadhu visited the palace and gave her father a Deity of Krsna. He was reluctant to give it to Mira, as he was afraid she might not value it, but when Mira saw Krsna she insisted on having Him, and screamed and refused to eat until He was given to her. \r\n\r\nAs time went on things worsened for her at home, one day, after the death of her husband, she secretly left for Sri Vrndavana-dhama and settled at the place where this temple is today. On the altar are Radha-Manohara, and on our left side of Them is a Deity of Mirabai playing karatalas. To the right of the altar area is a small room that is said to have been her sitting place.\r\n\r\nSrila Prabhupada mentions that Mirabai appreciated Lord Caitanya, \u201cShe appreciated that Lord Caitanya is Krsna, and she has written one poetry, song, that \u2018Now You have left aside Your flute, and You have taken the sannyasi rod.\u2019 In that way, she has written nice poetry. \u2018And where is Your hair and peacock feather? Now You are bald-headed.\u2019 In this way. So Mira appreciated.\u201d"

His idea was that Radha-Ramana should come from His small temple to this magnificent palace where He could be more easily taken care of, and the whole ambiance would be more in keeping with His position as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Radha-Ramana Himself, however, had other ideas and refused to come, so other Deities were installed. \r\nThe present Deities are known as \u201cChota Radha-Ramana,\u201d or \u201cSmall Radha-Ramana.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn front of the temple are twelve four-meter tall pillars of carved marble, each made from a single piece of stone. Inside there is the temple room and another special room known as the \u201cVasanti Kamra\u201d or the \u201cSpring Room\u201d where the Deities stay for two days a year around the time of Vasant Pancami, the day of the lunar calendar on which spring officially starts. In this room, there is an outstanding collection of old Belgian chandeliers and ornamental light fixtures which are lit up for the pleasure of the Deities only on these two days in the year. It is quite a spectacle, and thousands of people come from all over Vraja to have this special darsana."

Sarvabhauma was a member of one of the Gosvami families of the Radha-Ramana temple in Vrndavana. One of his disciples in Calcutta, Radha-Govinda Gosvami, installed the Deity in Calcutta. Radha-Govinda Gosvami had no children and, in his later age, wondered who would continue the service of Amiya Nimai, as the Deity had come to be known. Amiya Nimai came to the Gosvami in a dream and told him to contact Krsna Caitanya Gosvami of the Radha-Ramana temple and get him to take Him to Vrndavana.\r\n\r\nFollowing the dream, Radha-Govinda Gosvami and Krsna Caitanya Gosvami discussed the matter for some time in a series of letters without reaching a conclusion, and shortly afterward, Radha-Govinda Gosvami passed away. Krsna Caitanya Gosvami arranged in 1936 that Amiya Nimai be transported from Calcutta to Vrndavana, where He was installed in a room by the rasa-mandala outside the main entrance to the Radha-Ramana temple. The worship went on there for some time, and then in 1954 Krsna Caitanya Gosvami obtained land in the Gopinatha Bazaar area of Vrndavana town, and Amiya Nimai\u2019s new temple was opened there in 1956.\r\n\r\nHe is a magnificent Deity and is worshiped very nicely, still under the care of the devotees of Radha-Ramana temple."

But the Holy name of Lord Krsna is non-different from Him, so if I chant in the bathroom, He will be exposed to all the nastiness there. If I could, I would simply stop chanting, but the problem is that I can't stop no matter how hard I try, and therefore I am holding My tongue to avoid making that offense\".Gopala replied: \"Please don't worry, my Lord. The time of death is the most contaminated time of all even worse than when we are in the bathroom, but sastras say that at the time of death, we must chant the Holy names of the Lord. So it is all right for you to chant in the bathroom\u201d. \r\nLord Caitanya was astonished and said: \"Thank you so much, Gopala! You've convinced me! From today on, you are my guru\u00bb. From that time, Gopal became known as Gopal Guru, and later, when he took sannyasa, he became known as Gopala Guru Gosvami. \r\nThe Deities in the Radhakanta temple in Vrindavana are pratibhu forms of the original Deities in Puri. On the right side of the temple courtyard is the Deity of Gopala Guru, and to the left of this Deity is the tree that he is said to have been sitting under and chanting, when his followers found him."

It seems that he lived most of his life in Bengal. His complete Samadhi is located in the center of the courtyard of this temple. One day, Lord Caitanya went to see Gauridasa at Ambika Kalna, after crossing the Ganges in a boat from Shantipur. He told the Pandit: \"I went to Shantipur, from there I sailed on the boat to the village Haryadi. I crossed the Ganges in a rowboat. This is the paddle you take it. I give it to you. With this paddle, humanity can cross the ocean of this material world.\" Having said this, the Lord embraced Gauridasa Pandita. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu personally told Gauridas to carve the Deities of himself and Lord Nityananda out of the neem tree, which He did. He worshipped Them day and night, chanting the Holy names of the Lord, and the Deities communicated with him every day. One day he prepared a great feast for Gaura-Nitai and placed it on the altar before Them, but They were silent. In anger Gauridas said to the Deities: \"If You are satisfied without food, why do You force me to cook for You? \" the Gaura-Nitai replied,\"Gauridas, you are never satisfied with cooking a small amount of food. You always want to cook a lot. When We ask you not to cook so much, you never listen. It hurts Us to see how hard you work just to make Us dinner. Remember, the most pleasant offering for Us will be something that will be easy for you to prepare.\" Gauridas replied: \"I will never do it again! From this moment on, I will only offer You boiled rice and spinach!\u00bb The two gentlemen laughed and began to eat what he had prepared for Them. \"You have so much devotion that whatever you prepare will satisfy Us very much,\" said Lord Nityananda."

Some of the Vrajavasis took it that Krsna was trying to preach jnana to them and somehow cheat them of His personal association, so they tore the letters, which were written on cloth inti rags and threw them into the Yamuna here. Therefore, this place is known traditionally as Jnana Gudadi, the place where the Jnana was torn into rags.

        "description": "The Gopala-tapani Upanishad describes a pastime that happened here: Once, after they had passed the night in conjugal pastimes with Him, the passionate girls of Vraja asked Krishna: \"To what brahmana should charity be given?\u00bb Krishna replied: \"To Durvasa\". The sage Durvasa was living on the other side of the Yamuna, so the gopis asked: \"How will we cross the Yamuna\u2019s waters and approach him, from whom great blessings will come?\u00bb Krishna said: \"Just say the words: \"Krsna is the topmost brahmachari,\" and the Yamuna will give you a path. By remembering Me, a shallow person becomes deep. By remembering Me, an impure person becomes pure. By remembering Me, an impious person becomes pious. By remembering Me, one full material desires becomes desireless. By remembering Me, a fool becomes learned.\" \r\n\r\nAfter hearing this, the gopis, anxious to get the mercy of Durvasa, repeated Krsna\u2019s words, and to their surprise the waters of the Yamuna parted and allowed them to cross. They went to the sacred ashrama and bowed down before Durvasa Muni, the best of sages, and gave him delicious foods made with milk and ghee. Pleased with them, he took bath, ate the prasadam they had offered, blessed them, and then gave them permission to return home. But the gopis became disturbed: \"How will we cross the Yamuna?\u00bb they asked. Durvasa replied: \"Just meditate on me as a sage who eats only durva grass, and the Yamuna will give you a path.\" \r\nSrimati Radharani reflected for a moment and then asked him, \"We know Krsna very well. He always pursues us for amorous pastimes. How can anyone say He\u2019s a brahmacari? And we just saw you eat a big feast. How could anyone say you eat only durva grass?\u201d When she placed these questions before Durvasa Muni, the other girls became silent. \r\nDurvasa answered their second question, regarding himself first, \"Sound is contained within the element ether, although sound and ether are different. The ether does not know this. And I am spirit. How can I be a materialistic enjoyer? Touch is contained within the element air, although touch and air are different. The air doesn't know this. I am a spirit. How can I be a materialistic enjoyer? Form is contained within the element fire, although - form and fire are different. Fire doesn't know this. And I am a spirit."

They therefore appealed to Krsna to help them satisfy their hunger. He directed them to approach some brahmanas who were performing an animal sacrifice nearby and request in His and Balarama\u2019s names to give some food. The boys went and very humbly presented their please to the brahmanas, but they arrogantly ignored the boys, who then ran back to Lord Krsna. \r\nKrsna told the boys to approach the wives of the same brahmanas and ask them,as they were His devotees. The boys went and requested the ladies to give food as Krishna was nearby and was very hungry. The chaste ladies immediately gathered all different types of nice food, and despite the objections of their husbands, came to meet Krsna here on the banks of the River Yamuna."

First Krsna and Balarama bathed, and then, when They returned to sit in the chariot, Akrura took permission from Them to take bath. He was standing half-submerged in the Yamuna, chanting gayatri, when he suddenly saw Krishna and Balarama in the water again. Surprised, he came out of the water, but then saw that They were still seated in the chariot, and he thought he must have been mistaken when he thought he saw Them in the water. He went back into the river, but saw Them there again, and this time not alone, but surrounded by all sort of great personalities, including many of the demigods, and a great number of Siddhas, Caranas, and Gandharvas, all of whom were bowing down before Krsna and Balarama. \r\n\r\nLord Sesanaga was also there, dressed in blue clothes, His white necks appearing just like snow-capped mountains. Akrura saw Krsna lying on Ananta Sesa in a four-armed form, looking astonishingly beautiful. Seeing this Akrura was overwhelmed, and he offered beautiful prayer to the Lord, but then suddenly while he was still glorifying Him, the vision disappeared. \r\nWhen Lord Caitanya visited Vrndavana, he stayed here some of the time, spending the nights here and during the day going out to visit different holy places. He once became absorbed here in remembrance of Akrura meditating in the water and seeing Krsna there, and jumped in, staying under water for some time, until his assistant, Balabhadra Bhattacharya, with great difficulty manage to pull Him out. As a result of this incident, Balabhadra Bhattacharya felt forced to take Lord Caitanya out of Vrndavana, and the Lord, even though He did not really want to go, agreed to leave. \r\nIn those days, the Yamuna ran right past where the current temple is located, but now the river has moved some distance away. In the the temple are very nice Deities of Krishna and Balarama with Akrura between Them."
